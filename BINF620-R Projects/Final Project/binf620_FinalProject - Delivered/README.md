# Abstract

This study utilizes the 2022 National Survey of Children's Health to examine the complex interactions between social, family, and personal factors influencing mental health concerns (MHC) among youth aged 6-17. Utilizing a comprehensive data set, the research employed logistic regression models to investigate potential predictors of mental health outcomes.

The analysis revealed promising results, with model accuracies exceeding 80%, peaking at 84.6%. Key predictive factors emerged, including gender, physical activity levels, after-school participation, experiences of bullying, and instances of discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. While logistic regression models demonstrated potential, the attempted neural network approach did not yield conclusive results due to time and methodological constraints. This should be an area of focus is further research.

This research contributes to the growing understanding of youth mental health by highlighting the multifaceted nature of mental health concerns and identifying critical areas for further investigation. The findings highlight the importance of comprehensive approaches to understanding and supporting adolescent mental health in the post-pandemic landscape.

There were still multiple variable interactions that showed promising results. Sex was also a significant factor. Another factor was physical activity and the number of after school activities. The other two obvious interactions were being bullied and whether one was being picked on for gender identity or sexuality issues. These factor should be explore further. The aim of the neural network was to combine these factors into one analysis, but not enough success was found.

Though this research may not have been a publishing success, may lessons were learned and future research viability was formed on the basis of the predictors selected.

# Notes

I would say that I feel a bit defeated with over 30 hours contributed to this project I felt that when created the neural networks i just kept running in circles. I had a good model that was once working, but could never seem to replicate the results. I had organized my entire paper around a neural network that worked, and I never got that far. I finally decided that for my sanity, the best thing to do was to write this paper admitting it faults, with the goal for future improvements. I really wanted this network to work, but guess that I didn't have the right model selected or figure out the pieces that could have made it better.

This project showcased for me that I can work hard and fail sometimes, and that is sorta okay. I truly don't want this to be the end of this project for me, as I feel that I am close, but just needed some more time that I did not have.
