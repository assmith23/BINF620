# Part 1

**Bayes Rule**\
$$
p(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

We have:\

$$
\begin{aligned}
  F = P(F) &= .90 \\
  M = P(M) &= .1 \\
  P(R|M) &= .95 \\
  P(R|F) &= .08 \\
  F \cup M &= \Omega
\end{aligned}
$$

We want:\

$$
\begin{aligned}
  P(M|R) &= \\
         &= \frac{P(R|M)P(M)}{P(R)}\\
    P(R) &=  \text{ ?}
\end{aligned}
$$

See that we can calculate the value of $P(R)$ as

$$
\begin{aligned}
  P(R) &= P(R|M)P(M) + P(R|F)P(F) \\
       &= (.95)(.1) + (.08)(.9) = .167 \\
       \\
P(M|R) &= \frac{(.95)(.1)}{(.167)} \\
       &= .57       
\end{aligned}
$$
Notice that $P(M|R)=.57$, meaning that given there is a rash the probability that it is measles causing the rash is $57%$. I would say that the doctors have the wrong impression that there is a $95%$ chance that the child as measles. We save safely say that there is closer to a $50/50$ chance that the child has measles. Intuitively, this can be rationed from the idea that measles is considerably less prevalent in the population thus even though it is more likely to have a rash associated to it, due to the low volume of measles cases there is less of a chance the child contracted measles.

# Part 2

## Question 1

**We will try to predict** `BF5EVER`.\
**Predictors:** `PGWT_GN,MOM_CM, MOM_BMI, MOMCIG, CIG_PRIOR, MOM_LBKG`.\
**Model:** `BF5EVER ~ PGWT_GN + MOM_CM + MOM_BMI + MOMCIG + CIG_PRIOR + MOM_LBKG`.\

## Question 2

## 2a)

**Using “featurePlot“ in “caret” to obtain Feature plots, Scatter Plot Matrix, and Box-Plots.**

```{r Q2a_density, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
caret::featurePlot(x = imputedALIVE[, c("PGWT_GN", "MOM_CM", "MOM_BMI", "MOMCIG", "CIG_PRIOR", "MOM_LBKG")],
            y = as.factor(imputedALIVE$BF5EVER),
            plot = "density")
```

```{r Q2a_box, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
caret::featurePlot(x = imputedALIVE[, c("PGWT_GN", "MOM_CM", "MOM_BMI", "MOMCIG", "CIG_PRIOR", "MOM_LBKG")],
            y = as.factor(imputedALIVE$BF5EVER),
            plot = "box")
```

```{r Q2a_pairs, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
caret::featurePlot(x = imputedALIVE[, c("PGWT_GN", "MOM_CM", "MOM_BMI", "MOMCIG", "CIG_PRIOR", "MOM_LBKG")],
            y = as.factor(imputedALIVE$BF5EVER),
            plot = "pairs")
```


### 2b)

**Fit a multiple naïve Bayes model to predict the response using the six predictors. Describe your results,including prior probabilities, Conditional probabilities, predictions, and Accuracy.**

```{r Q2b, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
naive_model <- naive_bayes(as.factor(BF5EVER) ~ PGWT_GN + MOM_CM + MOM_BMI + MOMCIG + CIG_PRIOR + MOM_LBKG, data = imputedALIVE)
summary(naive_model)
```

**Prior Distribution:**\
$$
\begin{aligned}
   \text{BF5EVER = No}  &= 1: .16 \\
   \text{BF5EVER = Yes} &= 2: .84
\end{aligned}
$$
The prior distribution indicates that in the sample, a significant majority of mothers $(83.59%)$ have breastfed their babies at some point.

**Conditional Probabilities:**\
This naive bayes model assumes a Gaussian distributions for the predictors.\

```{r Q2b_tables, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
# Model Tables
naive_model$tables
```

In summary, mothers who breastfed gained slightly more weight on average during pregnancy. There is no difference in height of mothers. The mother BMI was slightly lower for those who breastfed. Non-breastfeeding mothers smoked more cigarettes on average. For cigarettes before pregnancy, results were similar to that of smoked during pregnancy. Lastly, mothers not breastfeeding had a higher pre pregnancy weight.

**Predictions and Accuracy:**\
An accuracy of $81.3%$ was determined to be good but not the most ideal. The true negative rate was $93.9%$, suggesting the model is better predicting mothers that breastfed rather than those that did not.

```{r Q2b_predictions, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
# Makes Predictions
predictions <- predict(naive_model, imputedALIVE)

# Form confusion Matrix
confusionMatrix(predictions, as.factor(imputedALIVE$BF5EVER))
```

**Summary:**\
Overall, the model had good accuracy and strong specificity, but it struggles to identify mothers who did not breastfeed. Mothers who breastfed gained slightly more weight during pregnancy, had lower pre-pregnancy BMI, and smoked less both during and before pregnancy, as identified by the predictors. However, the model struggled to predict non-breastfeeding, while the opposite's accuracy was solid.[^1]

## Question 3

**We will try to predict** `BF5EVER`.\
**Predictors:** `PGWT_GN, MOM_CM, MOM_BMI, MOMCIG, CIG_PRIOR, MOM_LBKG`.\
**Model:** `BF5EVER ~ PGWT_GN + MOM_CM + MOM_BMI + MOMCIG + CIG_PRIOR + MOM_LBKG`.\

### 3a)

**Fit a linear discriminant model to predict the response using the six predictors. Describe your results, including priori probabilities of groups, group means, coefficients of linear discriminant, predictions and Accuracy.**

```{r Q3a_split, echo=TRUE}
# Split Data
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(imputedALIVE$BF5EVER, p = 0.7, list = FALSE, times = 1)
data_trn <- imputedALIVE[trainIndex, ]
data_tst <- imputedALIVE[-trainIndex, ]
```

Source for spiting the data set.[^2]\

```{r Q3a_results, echo=TRUE}
# LDA Model
alive_lda = lda(BF5EVER ~ PGWT_GN + MOM_CM + MOM_BMI + MOMCIG + CIG_PRIOR + MOM_LBKG, data = data_trn)
#alive_lda
```

LDA code taking from notes provided in the module.\

**Prior Probabilities:**\
```{r Q3a_prior, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
alive_lda$prior
```
$$
\begin{aligned}
   \text{BF5EVER = No}  &= 1: .17 \\
   \text{BF5EVER = Yes} &= 2: .84
\end{aligned}
$$
Notice there is a slight difference in this model compared to our naive bayes. The prior probabilities suggest that a higher proportion of mothers in the training dataset breastfed their infants compared to those who did not. This imbalance may influence the model's predictions.

**Group Means:**\

```{r Q3a_means, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
kable(alive_lda$counts, caption = "Counts", format = "html")
kable(alive_lda$means, caption = "Group Means", format = "html")
```

- `PGWT_GN`: Mothers who did not breastfeed gained slightly less weight during pregnancy on average.
- `MOM_CM`: The height difference between the two groups is minimal.
- `MOM_BMI`: Non-breastfeeding mothers have a higher average BMI.
- `MOMCIG`: Non-breastfeeding mothers smoke more cigarettes per day on average.
- `CIG_PRIOR`: Non-breastfeeding mothers smoked more prior to pregnancy.
- `MOM_LBKG`: Mothers who breastfed had lower average weights before pregnancy.

**coefficients of linear Discriminants:**\
```{r Q3a_discrims, echo=TRUE}
coefDiscrim <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("PGWT_GN", "MOM_CM", "MOM_BMI", "MOMCIG", "CIG_PRIOR", "MOM_LBKG"),
  LD1 = c(0.003902853, 0.060731142, 0.083359371, -0.164828374, -0.068187890, -0.021325825)
)

kable(coefDiscrim, caption = "Coefficients of linear discriminants", format = "html")
```

*Positive coefficients:*\
`PGWT_GN, MOM_CM, MOM_BMI`. These indicate that higher values are associated with increased odds of breastfeeding.

*Negative coefficients:*\
`MOMCIG, CIG_PRIOR, MOM_LBKG`. These indicate that higher values are associated with decreased odds of breastfeeding. Therefore, the results suggest that smoking and a lower pre-pregnancy weight of the mother may influence breastfeeding.

**Predictions and Accuracy:**\

```{r Q3a_predict, echo=TRUE}
# Predict
data_trn_pred <- predict(alive_lda, data_trn)
data_tst_pred <- predict(alive_lda, data_tst)

# Store Predictions
predictions_trn <- data_trn_pred$class
predictions_tst <- data_tst_pred$class

# Calculate classification error
calc_class_err <- function(actual, predicted) {
  mean(actual != predicted)
}

# Check accuracy on the training set
accuracy_trn <- mean(predictions_trn == data_trn$BF5EVER)

# Check accuracy on the test set
accuracy_tst <- mean(predictions_tst == data_tst$BF5EVER)

# Create confusion matrices
conf_matrix_trn <- table(predictions_trn, data_trn$BF5EVER)
conf_matrix_tst <- table(predictions_tst, data_tst$BF5EVER)

# Output results
accuracy_trn
accuracy_tst
kable(conf_matrix_trn, caption = "Coefficient Matrix of Train | LDA", format = "html")
kable(conf_matrix_tst, caption = "Coefficient Matrix of Test  | LDA", format = "html")
```

*Training Set Accuracy:* $\approx$ `r round(accuracy_trn, 2)`\
The LDA model achieved a training accuracy of approximately $83.04%$. This means it can effectively classify breastfeeding status. Once again, this model suggests that we are good at predicting when a mother breastfeeds this child, but not so good as predicting when they don't breastfeed. This can be seen in that the predictors, especially smoking-related variables, have a significant influence on breastfeeding decisions.

**Summary:**\
The model indicated that the training dataset showed a higher proportion of mothers who breastfed their infants. Group means revealed that non-breastfeeding mothers tended to have a higher BMI, smoke more cigarettes, and gained slightly less weight during pregnancy. On the other hand, breastfeeding mothers had a lower pre-pregnancy weights, in general. From the linear discriminant analysis, we achieved enough of an approximate to suggest the effectiveness of classifying the status of breastfeeding, However, there are challenges in predicting non-breastfeeding due to the influence of smoking and pre-pregnancy weight for the decisions of breastfeeding.[^3]

### 3b)

**Fit a quadratic discriminant model to predict the response using the six predictors. Describe your results, including priori probabilities of groups, group means, predictions and Accuracy.**

```{r Q3b_results, echo=TRUE}
# QDA Model
alive_qda = qda(BF5EVER ~ PGWT_GN + MOM_CM + MOM_BMI + MOMCIG + CIG_PRIOR + MOM_LBKG, data = data_trn)
#alive_qda
```

**Prior Probabilities:**\
$$
\begin{aligned}
   \text{BF5EVER = No}  &= 1: .17 \\
   \text{BF5EVER = Yes} &= 2: .83
\end{aligned}
$$
Similar to the lda model, the prior probabilities suggest that a higher proportion of mothers in the training dataset breastfed their infants compared to those who did not.

**Group Means:**\

```{r Q3b_means, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, include=TRUE}
kable(alive_qda$counts, caption = "Counts", format = "html")
kable(alive_qda$means, caption = "Group Means", format = "html")
```

- `PGWT_GN`: On average, mothers who breastfed gained slightly more weight during pregnancy.
- `MOM_CM`: There is minimal difference in height between the two groups.
- `MOM_BMI`: The BMI is higher for mothers who never breastfed.
- `MOMCIG` and `CIG_PRIOR`: Mothers who never breastfed smoke significantly more cigarettes both during and before pregnancy.
- `MOM_LBKG`: The mothers who breastfed tend to have lower weights before pregnancy.

**Predictions and Accuracy:**\
```{r Q3b_predict, echo=TRUE}
# Predict
data_trn_pred <- predict(alive_qda, data_trn)
data_tst_pred <- predict(alive_qda, data_tst)

# Store Predictions
predictions_trn <- data_trn_pred$class
predictions_tst <- data_tst_pred$class

# Calculate classification error
calc_class_err <- function(actual, predicted) {
  mean(actual != predicted)
}

# Check accuracy on the training set
accuracy_trn <- mean(predictions_trn == data_trn$BF5EVER)

# Check accuracy on the test set
accuracy_tst <- mean(predictions_tst == data_tst$BF5EVER)

# Create confusion matrices
conf_matrix_trn <- table(predictions_trn, data_trn$BF5EVER)
conf_matrix_tst <- table(predictions_tst, data_tst$BF5EVER)

# Output results
accuracy_trn
accuracy_tst
kable(conf_matrix_trn, caption = "Coefficient Matrix of Train | QDA", format = "html")
kable(conf_matrix_tst, caption = "Coefficient Matrix of Test  | QDA", format = "html")
```

The accuracy of the model on the training data was approximately $81.18$%. Thus meaning, the model correctly classified $81.18$% of the training instances.

**Summary:**\
Overall, the QDA model suggests strong evidence when predicting the status breastfeeding from the selected predictors. Certain predictors such as smoking an mother weight suggest higher predictability for the status of breastfeeding.

\newpage
### 3c)
**Compare the results from a) and b), which model do you think is better to fit the data? Justify your answer.**\

```{r Q3c, echo=TRUE}
data <- data.frame(
  Metric = c(
    "Prior Probabilities","Group Means","PGWT_GN","MOM_CM","MOM_BMI","MOMCIG","CIG_PRIOR","MOM_LBKG","Training Set Accuracy","Test Set Accuracy","Confusion Matrix (Training)","True Positives (TP)","False Positives (FP)","True Negatives (TN)","False Negatives (FN)","Confusion Matrix (Test)","True Positives (TP)","False Positives (FP)","True Negatives (TN)","False Negatives (FN)"),
  LDA = c("1: 16.69%, 2: 83.31%",NA,30.39,162.58,26.77,2.29,3.97,156.23,"83.04%","83.06%",NA,1250,1606,110306,20856,NA,496,646,8969,8968
  ),
  QDA = c(
    "1: 16.69%, 2: 83.31%",NA,30.39,162.58,26.77,2.29,3.97,156.23,"81.17%","81.18%",NA,3978,6809,103497,18128,NA,1717,2934,44348,7748),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

kable(data, caption = "Analysis Between LDA and QDA", format = "html")
```

Based on the two models tested, the LDA outperforms QDA in terms of accuracy for both the training and test sets. That being said, the choice of model should also consider the underlying assumptions: if the assumptions of LDA hold, it is typically a preferred model due to its higher accuracy and interpretability.\
Therefore, in this analysis, LDA is recommended as the better-performing model for predicting breastfeeding status `BF5EVER` based on the given predictors.
