# Background
Mental health concerns among children and adolescents represent one of the most pressing public health challenges of the 21st century, with profound implications for individual development, family functioning, and societal well-being. Globally, approximately 1 in 7 youth experience a diagnosable mental health disorder, and higher rates are presented in the United States (WHO, 2023a). This study employs a comprehensive analytical approach to examine how these multilevel factors interact to influence mental health outcomes among youth aged 6-17 years, with the aim of identifying key predictors and potential points of intervention that could meaningfully impact the trajectory of youth mental health.

## Mental Health Concerns
The adolescent period represents a critical developmental window for mental health, with the World Health Organization noting that half of all mental health disorders in adulthood begin by age 18, though most cases remain undetected and untreated [**[#]**](#link1). Mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury among adolescents, with depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders among the leading causes of illness and disability in this population [**[#]**](#link2). The growing prevalence of these conditions underscores the importance of identifying risk factors that can inform early intervention and prevention strategies. Furthermore, other studies suggest the assocation between social withdraw and mental health, suggesting a reverse interaction that thoes more involved in social frameworks may have a positive impact on an individual's mental health [**[#]**](#ref3).

### Social Media Effects

## Risk Factors
Current research emphasizes that adolescent mental health is influenced by a complex interplay of factors operating at multiple levels. These factors do not operate in isolation but rather "interact and are closely interconnected, directly or indirectly contributing to adolescent psychopathology"[**[#]**](#ref4).

### Individual Risk Factors
Individual characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, physical activity levels, and screen time usage have been identified as significant predictors of mental health outcomes. Studies have found that "rates of increase in depression are higher for girls than for boys; the same is true for rates of overanxious disorder" [**[#]**](#ref5). These findings support the inclusion of demographic and behavioral variables in predictive models of adolescent mental health.

### Family Dynamics Factors
The family environment and family history play a crucial role in shaping adolescent mental health outcomes. Family structure, parental mental health, and the quality of family relationships significantly impact youth development, with research emphasizing that "parents' interactions with their children are among the strongest proximal predictors of children's neurodevelopment" and that "the family environment, with all its complexity and diverse components, plays a critical role in shaping neurodevelopmental outcomes in children" (Petrowski et al., 2020).

### Family and Social Factors
Social connections and peer relationships represent another critical domain influencing adolescent mental health. The WHO notes that "factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of identity" (WHO, 2023a). This study examines variables related to after-school activities, event participation, and mentorship to assess their protective or risk effects on mental health outcomes.

### Neighborhood Factors
The broader social environment, including neighborhood safety and support, significantly influences adolescent mental health. "Some adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services" [**[L#]**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-mental-health). This study examines neighborhood safety, support, and community-level adverse childhood experiences to assess their impact on youth mental health outcomes.

### Adverse Experiences
Exposure to adverse experiences represents a significant risk factor for poor mental health outcomes. "Violence (especially sexual violence and bullying), harsh parenting and severe socioeconomic problems are recognized risks to mental health" (WHO, 2023a). This study incorporates measures of bullying, victimization, adverse childhood experiences, discrimination, and household adversities to comprehensively assess the impact of negative experiences on youth mental health.

## Study Approach
Given the complex and multifaceted nature of factors influencing adolescent mental health, this study employs both traditional statistical approaches and advanced machine learning methodologies to identify key predictors and their interactions. By examining the relative importance of different risk factors, evaluating the predictive performance of various analytical approaches, and identifying interactions between social factors, this study aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the determinants of mental health concerns in children and adolescents. The findings will inform targeted intervention strategies that address the most influential risk factors and leverage protective factors to promote positive mental health outcomes in this vulnerable population.

# Study Design
This study aimed to examine the relationships influencing mental health concerns among youth aged 6-17 years. The primary aim was to identify and quantify the interaction of individual, family, and social factors and the association with mental health concerns in children and adolescents, utilizing both traditional statistical approaches and advanced machine learning methodologies.

## Aims
1. To determine the relative importance of different risk factors being: individual characteristics, family environment, social connections, adverse experiences, and neighborhood factors, in predicting mental health outcomes.

2. To evaluate the predictive performance of various analytical approaches, including logistic regression, regularized regression, ensemble methods, and principal component analysis-based models.

3. To examine interaction between various social factors being: after school activities, bullying, and neighborhood support in predicting mental health concerns.

4. To identify the most influential set of predictors that can effectively classify mental health risk.

## Population Selection

### Target Population
The study population consisted of children and adolescents aged 6-17 years participating in the 2022 NSCH. This age range was selected to capture the critical developmental period during which many mental health conditions first emerge and when social, academic, and family environmental factors become increasingly influential.

### Sampleing
The NSCH employs a complex probability sampling design to produce nationally representative estimates. The survey utilizes a two-sections :
- Section 1: Four questions about the presence of children in the home
- Section 2: Detailed questions on the demographics and health of children

Survey results were taken as is and the following criteria was applied:
- Children aged 6-17 years at the time of survey administration
- Complete or sufficiently complete data on the primary outcome variable (mental health concerns)

Following data cleaning, the analytical dataset comprised over 20,000 observations, ensuring adequate statistical power for complex modeling approaches and subgroup analyses. The large sample size enabled robust estimation of interaction effects and supported the implementation of data-intensive machine learning algorithms while maintaining sufficient sample size for model validation through train-test splitting procedures.

## Data and Materials
### Data Source
This analysis utilized the 2022 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The NSCH is an annual cross-sectional survey designed to produce national and state-level estimates of child health and well-being across multiple domains.

### Survey Design
The survey is primarily a mail-based data collection survey with online and telephone completion options. The survey domains, examined in this research include:
- Child health
- Healthcare access
- Family dynamics and support systems
- Neighborhood characteristics
- School engagement
- Adverse childhood experiences

### Dataset
The final dataset was a subset from the `NSCH_2022e_Topical_CSV_CAHMI_DRCv2.csv`. The original data contained over 300 survey collection variables as well as over 200 calculated variables based on the provide codebook. In total, the codebook contains $579$ variables. An alternate version of the unaltered dataset can be found on [**census.gov**](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets/nsch2022.html). 

A smaller subset of this data was created for the purposes of this research and can be found in the project github available in the resources[**[#]**](#github).

# Statistical Analysis
The study employed a comprehensive analytical approach combining traditional statistical methods with advanced machine learning techniques to examine predictors of mental health concerns among adolescents.

## Reproducibility
Analysis code was version-controlled and documented to ensure reproducibility. A Random seed was set a `seed = 1776` for all stochastic procedures to enable exact replication of results.

## Response Variable
The primary outcome variable was mental health concerns `MHealthConcern`, constructed as a binary indicator based on responses to survey questions regarding current mental health conditions. More specifically, the indicator to into account the variables `K2Q33B` and `K2Q32B`, indicating whether their child currently has depression or anxiety. If the response was "yes" to either condition, the resulting value was "yes".

## Data Processing
### Missing Data Imputation
Missing data were addressed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) implemented in R. The imputation model utilized predictive mean matching (PMM) with 5 imputed datasets and 50 iterations to ensure convergence. Complete case analysis was performed on the imputed dataset to maintain statistical power while preserving the integrity of relationships between variables. This dataset was saved an utilized in python for PCA.

### Data Scailing / Standardizing

## Analytical Approaches
Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to examine the distribution of mental health concerns across predictor variables. Proportional differences were visualized using grouped bar charts and cross-tabulations to identify preliminary associations.

### Statistical Models
#### Logistic Regression
Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to examine associations between predictor variables and mental health outcomes. The six domain-specific models, described above, were developed to systematically examine different frameworks. 

#### Regularized Logistic Regression
To address potential multicollinearity and perform variable selection, elastic net regularization was implemented using the glmnet package. The optimal lambda parameter was selected through 5-fold cross-validation, with alpha = 0.5 to balance ridge and lasso penalties.

##### Interaction Effects
Two-way interactions were examined between key variables, specifically:
- After-school activities × sex
- Physical activity × after-school activities

## Machine Learning Approaches
### Random Forest Classification
Random forest models were implemented using 500 trees with importance calculations enabled. The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using stratified sampling to maintain outcome distribution balance.
### Gradient Boosting Machine
GBM models were fitted with 500 trees, interaction depth of 3, and shrinkage parameter of 0.05. Optimal tree count was determined using out-of-bag error estimation.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA was performed on standardized predictor variables to identify underlying latent constructs and reduce dimensionality while preserving maximum variance. The optimal number of components was determined using multiple criteria:

- Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues > 1)
- Cumulative variance explained (80% threshold)
- Scree plot examination for elbow identification

### Componet Analysis
Principal component loadings were examined to understand the contribution of original variables to each component, with visualization through heatmaps to identify variable clustering patterns.

### PCA Modeling
Logistic regression and random forest models were fitted using the selected principal components as predictors to compare performance with original variable models.

## Model Evaluation
### Performance Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using various metrics for binary classification:

- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC): Primary metric for model discrimination ability
- Accuracy: Overall correct classification rate
- Sensitivity (Recall): True positive rate
- Specificity: True negative rate
- Precision: Positive predictive value

### Model Comparison
Models were compared using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as the primary performance metric, with additional evaluation using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. ROC curve analysis was employed to assess model discrimination ability and compare performance across different analytical approaches.

### Variable Importance
## Analysis Environments
All analyses were conducted using R version 4.x and Python 3.x. Key R packages included: mice (imputation), glmnet (regularized regression), randomForest, gbm, caret (model training), and pROC (ROC analysis). Python analyses utilized scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy libraries.

Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05 for all tests, with 95% confidence intervals reported for odds ratios and effect estimates.
